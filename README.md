* Save and share your custom effects.
* Ease understandable nodetree.

# Location

# Documentation
The exstension was developed within an Anime workflow primarily using After Effects. Some simple compositing was required, which I hoped to accomplish using Blender. Therefore, the addon's workflow is similar to After Effects. If you've used it before, this will help you better understand the addon.

# Compatibility
Layer Comp is compatible with older Blender versions, starting from Blender 4.2. But the best use of the addon is version 4.5, some feature and node aren't available in 4.4 or below.
