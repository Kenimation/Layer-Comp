# Documentation
The extension was developed within an Anime workflow primarily using After Effects. Some simple compositing was required, which I hoped to accomplish using Blender.
Therefore, the addon's workflow is similar to After Effects. If you've used it before, this will help you better understand the addon.

This addon provides a system and pipeline; it won't provide many more feature node updates in the future. It relies on the user to create their effect presets.

# User Interface
* Drag layer and effect directly

Layer Comp is compatible with older Blender versions, starting from Blender 4.2. But the best use of the addon is version 4.5, some features and nodes aren't available in 4.4 or below.
