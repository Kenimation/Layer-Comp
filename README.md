# Documentation
The exstension was developed within an Anime workflow primarily using After Effects. Some simple compositing was required, which I hoped to accomplish using Blender.
Therefore, the addon's workflow is similar to After Effects. If you've used it before, this will help you better understand the addon.

This addon provides a system and pipeline; it won't provide many more feature nodes update in the future. It rely the user to create their effect presets.

# User Interface
* Drag layer and effect directly

# Save and share your custom effects
* Custom effect requires node group type and one 'Image' input, and at least one output

# Future
* Add sub socket for effect node
* Better output system

# Compatibility
Layer Comp is compatible with older Blender versions, starting from Blender 4.2. But the best use of the addon is version 4.5, some feature and node aren't available in 4.4 or below.
